Avi and I took a walk along the Parc Ile-Bizard trails.
My 55mm Nikkor Micro f/2.8 was attached when we fell upon a field of buzzing white flowers.

The goals were to get (1) a bee drinking with its tongue out, (2) a pollen bulge, and (3) a bumblebee.

It took a little while, but we were successful!
